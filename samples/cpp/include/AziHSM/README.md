AziHSM Header File
==================

The `AziHSM.h` header file defines several strings and values that are required to be used with the [Windows NCrypt API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ncrypt) when interfacing with the AziHSM.
Please see the contents of the header file for descriptions, and use-cases, of each defined value.
When downloading AziHSM samples, or implementing your own application that uses the NCrypt API to interface with the AziHSM, you will need to download and include this header file in your application.
